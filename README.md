# Stock_prediction_RNN
This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of the stock you would like by using the past 90 day stock price.
Once you start the code you can either type help to get possible commands or start to start predicting.
To predict a stock you mush have the stock ticker symbol.
The program will run 5 times to take an average and store it in its own folder with todays date and stock being predicted.
